    "### The United States Census Bureau (USCB) conducts the decennial 'census' required under the United States Constitution, but also conducts many other information gathering and desemination programs.  Indeed, nearly $100 billion of the federal budget is allocated among local geographical units, such as census tracts, based upon those surveys and estimates.  One of the most important such surveys is the American Community Survey (ACS), conducted annually and analyzed at different geographic levels on an annual basis and on a five-year basis projecting to the then current year based upon the annual surveys taken over the period.  The five-year ACS Surveys take the analysis down to the level of census tracts and, in most cases, block groups:  these surveys form the nucleus of the data for our analysis here.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  In this research, I am taking data from the five-year ACS Surveys for 2012 (i.e., providing data gathered from 2007-2012) through the 2017 five-year survey that was released in stages starting in November, 2018:  the 2017 ACS survey is the most recent comprehensive data for our purposes.  Of the thousands of tables included in the survey, I have winnowed the selection down to what I believe to be six particularly relevant features for our study of households, in each case evaluated at the tract level.  There are roughly 220 census tracts covering the island of Manhattan, of roughly equal population density: in midtown and downtown, each tract typically includes 15-20 blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### In its tables, the USCB distinguishes between family-based data and household-based data.  The latter looks particularly to the individuals living in a single housing unit, without necessary regard to any relationship among them.  More detail can be found regarding this concept and its consequences in the survey information published by the USCB.  In general, for some survey purposes that will be relevant here, the attributes of a \"housholder\" is studied: this references a leader in the housing unit without regard to whether that unit is a single family home or, as will be nearly universally the situation in cases in which we are interested here, an owned or leased condominium or coop unit. We will look in detail at that data, with regard to the number of occupants [Table B11001], the highest educational level achieved by the householder [Table B15003], the twelve-month household income [Table B19001], the receipt of any passive income (interest, dividends, rent) by the household [Table B19054], the age of the structure in which the household unit is situated [Table B25034], and the monthly rent asked of the household unit [Table B25061].\n",

    "### Following my review of literature and experience in financing of economic development, my hypothesis is that successful rapid development of a restaurant-friendly neighborhood may be corollated with upward momentum in education, income, rents and investments of an upwardly mobile residential community.  The study of the census data is intended to provide a resource of features for our cluster analysis.  In this module, we will upload the data sets into Pandas dataframes, clean and normalize it, and then use a linear regression method to evaluate the upward (or downward) trend (or what I refer to as 'momentum') for each feature and on a census tract basis."

Here, we create a dictionary of results, one entry for each census tract that had valid data: the values in each entry are the slope (m) and the intercept (b) for the line, and the correlation factor (r), p-value (p) and standard error (std_err) for the fit to the data.

It discriminates between households comprising two or more members of a 'family' and those comprising one or more persons who are not of the same family; within the latter group, separate features include households of a persons living alone, on the one hand, and those of two or more persons. For purposes of our study, I have included only the latter two features since (i) the category of family households is the converse of the category of total nonfamily households (given the total number of responses); (ii) in the case of units occupied by families, no distinction is made between those with and those without children of a young age that might be relevant to decisions regarding dining at restaurants of the type contemplated in this study; but (iii) it is resonable to expect that the restaurant behavior of households comprising only one person would be different from that of households comprising two or more unrelated persons."
